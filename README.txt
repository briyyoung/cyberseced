TO USE OUR APP;
BE CONNECTED TO INTERNET
WAIT FOR THE APP TO CONNECT TO FIREBASE
IF NOTHING LOADS TRY REGRESHING AND REFER BELOW

Details
Our app uses firebase which needs the internet to connect to.
So please make sure that you are connected to the internet.
As a result of it needing internet connectivity there might be some delay.

You may enconter the following;
wait after signing up
wait to login in
wait to update profile
wait to load the posts feed
error encountered to play video in module page

To address the following issues;
you can use our login 
email- testlah8@gmail.com
password - 12345678
to bypass the signup.

minimising (with the tick option or backspace) the keyboard before you create a new user, login or change the profile seems to prevent some of the delay. 

If you are uplaoding an image, please make sure its a smaller sized one
otherwise the upload time will take longer.

*This own works for our login with testlah8@gmail.com*
If the post feed is empty please wait or go into the profile page
in the profile page there will be at first a blue man with an white background.
When that image changes to a dark blue icon of a man againist a black background, it means that the app has loaded 
information from the database, at which you can then navigate back to the post page to see the feed.

If the video does not load, please exit and reenter the page in order to refresh the connection.
